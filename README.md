Here I did a full analysis of survey data for an employee engagement survey that was carried out in a fictional company called `Universal Exports`.
I delivered back a report, presentation and a fully dynamic table.

# Tools used:
- Excel Pivot tables: For presenting a self service report for end users and decision makers.
- Power Query: For data transformations and cleaning.
